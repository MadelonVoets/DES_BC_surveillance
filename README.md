*Abstract*

*Objective*: Artificial intelligence (AI) in the interpretation of medical images promises to revolutionise healthcare. As prerequisite for clinical implementation, quantification of the expected impact of AI compared to usual care is necessary. In breast cancer surveillance imaging, AI may add value by early detection of recurrences. Therefore, this study explores how simulation modelling can be applied in breast cancer surveillance to assess the potential impact of AI in medical imaging on patient outcomes and healthcare costs.

*Methods*: A Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model was developed using real-world data, literature and expert elicitation. Individual recurrence risk was estimated using a validated time-dependent risk prediction model and detection probability was based on mammographic sensitivity and an underlying disease model. This DES-model was used to illustrate how an increase in sensitivity by AI affects clinical utility, and how different time intervals strategies impact clinical pathways. 

*Results*: The model estimated the clinical utility for three scenarios regarding improved AI-based sensitivity combined with strategies regarding the interval between surveillance moments. Although the bi-annual strategy produced relatively fewer routine detections of recurrences compared to usual care (25% vs. 34%), the increased sensitivity also resulted in relatively fewer missed recurrences compared to usual care (8% vs. 18%). Additionally, the model was internally validated and several parameters including VDT and annual risks were calibrated to match expected incidence of recurrence.

*Conclusion*: The developed simulation model can support healthcare providers regarding decisions on AI implementation through quantifying health and monetary benefits under a variety of breast cancer surveillance scenarios.
